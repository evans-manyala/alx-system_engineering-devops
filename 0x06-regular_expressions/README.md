# 0x06. REGULAR EXPRESSION

In computer programming, a regular expression (regex) is a special sequence of characters that defines a search pattern within text. Think of it like a powerful wildcard, but more versatile and precise. Regexes allow you to find, match, extract, or replace specific parts of text based on the patterns you define.

Here are some key things to understand about regexes:

    # Pattern matching

You build a regex pattern using literal characters and special characters with designated meanings (e.g., ., \*, +). These patterns match specific text sequences like letters, numbers, symbols, or combinations.

    # Powerful capabilities

Regexes can match complex patterns beyond simple searches. They can find repeated characters, groups of characters, specific formats (e.g., dates, emails), and even extract parts of the matched text using capturing groups.

    # Wide range of applications

Regexes are used in various programming languages and tools for tasks like:
Text search and replace: Find and replace specific words, phrases, or patterns in text files, code, databases, etc.

    # Data extraction

Extract relevant information from unstructured text, like names, prices, dates, from documents or web pages.

    # Input validation

Check if user input meets specific format requirements before being processed.

    # Text manipulation

Advanced text parsing, splitting, or joining based on regex patterns.

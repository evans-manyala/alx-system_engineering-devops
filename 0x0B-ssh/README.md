SSH stands for Secure Shell, which is a network protocol that allows secure remote access and control of devices over an unsecured network. It provides a secure way to access a remote computer or server and execute commands on it, transfer files, and tunnel other network services securely.

Here are some key features and aspects of SSH:

1. **Encryption:** SSH encrypts data transmitted between the client and the server, providing confidentiality and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information such as passwords or data being transferred.

2. **Authentication:** SSH uses various authentication methods to verify the identity of users and ensure secure access to the system. This can include password-based authentication, public key authentication, and multi-factor authentication.

3. **Secure Communication:** SSH ensures the integrity of data by using cryptographic algorithms to detect any tampering or modifications during transmission.

4. **Port Forwarding:** SSH can create secure tunnels between local and remote systems, allowing users to securely access services running on remote servers as if they were local.

5. **Remote Command Execution:** Users can execute commands on a remote server through SSH, making it a valuable tool for system administration, remote management, and automation tasks.

Overall, SSH is widely used in IT environments, especially for managing servers, accessing remote resources securely, and facilitating secure communication between systems over the internet or local networks.

In this Project Task, we are exploring using SSH scripts to complete actions required.
